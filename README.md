# Crypto Chart Dashboard

## Project Overview

This is a **Crypto Chart Dashboard** project built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Recharts**, and the **CoinGecko Public API**. It was an assignment project, where I implemented the following features:

- **Fullscreen/Exit Fullscreen**: A toggle to switch between fullscreen and normal modes.
- **Compare Option**: The ability to compare **Bitcoin (BTC)** with **Ethereum (ETH)**.
- **Figma Design**: The design follows a Figma layout, with the font **Circular Std** used as per the design specification.

## Features

- üîÑ Toggle between different time ranges for the chart (1D, 1W, 1M, etc.).
- üñºÔ∏è **Fullscreen mode** for better visualization.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Compare **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** side by side.
